         <p>Hey there! Here is a little rundown of a trip that I took back in 2015 where my now wife(Stella) and I started dating. Peru is a magical place with a lot to do.
             There is everything from bustling cities to the most amazing natural features. The nature aspect of Peru is awe inspiring. From the Nasca lines and Machu Picchu to the Amazon rain forest.
             The cities are great as well. Some of the worlds best food and world renound chefs.</p>
            <a name="Lima">
            <h2> Lima Peru</h2>
            </a> 
            
            <p>We began our trip in Lima Peru. While in Lima we made our way to our hostile in Mira Flores. The Taxi ride there was deffinitley interesting. It was like being in the Fast and furious movies.
            When we arrived we got changed and went out to explore the night life. We wound up meeting up with a guy that Stella's brother met on whatsapp. We met at a nightclub which was full of foriegn 
            exchange students from all over the world. We had a blast watching the live band. After we got an amazing burger in a pita style bread as we were wallking out of the club. The next day we got 
            up early and walked around in a park that goes up and down the coast. There was art and food vendors out. We stopped and got an delicious empanada (pictured here). Then it was off to Cusco.

             <h2>Cusco Peru</h2>  
            </a>
            <p>We arrived in Cusco after Lima. We checked into another hostile which only cost us about $30 per night. The accomidations were a little different than what one might be used to as an American.
               Luckily we did get our own room, but the bathroom was shared with all the guests. We then met up with Stella's brother and his friend who also came along on the trip. We went out that night to
               a resteruant recomended by some people in the town. Her brothers friend was not feeling well so we went without him. I got an alpaca steak and quinoa salad (pictured below). We only stayed here for the night and then we headed on the hike of a lifetime.

            <a name="Day one">
               <h2>Day One Salkantay Trail</h2>
            </a>
            <p>After a good meal and a decent nights sleep we went to meet up with her brother and his freind at their hostile. When we arrived we found them both still in thier beds. We found out that both of them 
               were up all night with a stomach bug(I'll spear the graphic details). Needless to say they missed the hike. The trail guides came and picked us up from the hostile and drove us to the trailhead. So, at
               this point we had only been in Peru for two whole days and in the mountains for one day while in Cusco. We got to the trailhead and started or five day adventure. Pitured below is the start of this hike.
               We were feeling good at this point and just enjoying the scenary. That mountain in the back of this photo is where we were going. It is called Salkantay. The peak is 20,574 ft above sea level. We got about 
               half way up it this day. We hiked for most of the day to get to camp. The altitude was already starting to get to me at this point. I decided to stay in the tent that evening. Stella decided to go on a side 
               excursion to a little lake on the side of the camp but further up the mountain. I was not feeling well so I went to dinner and stayed in the tent during the mingle time. Later Stella came back to the tent
               and we tried to fall asleep. I bet we slept for about two maybe three hours and then I woke up to Stella outside the tent with altitude sickness(again sparring details). Needless to say this was day one.

            <a name="Day Two">
               <h2>Day Two Salkantay Trail</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Day two was probably the hardest day of the hike. We were awakend with coca tea brought to the door of the tent by the trail guides. We were then provided breakfast and warm tea. It was pretty cold at this 
               point. Stella was still not feeling well. They took the people with altitude sickness on donkeys to the top, and Stella got to ride one. Although wouldn't call it a win with how she was feeling. Here is a 
               photo of me before we started this days hike. This is to this day the hardest hike I have done. The altitude got me like I've never felt before. We deffinitley should have spent more time acclimating. There 
               was a point where I cound't take more than ten to fifteen steps without gasping for air. But, we finally made it to the top. We didn't make it to the summit but pretty close. Once we were at the top they let 
               us enjoy the views for a bit, but then we booked it down to the next camp. We decended from a mountainous environment which gave way to the jungle and totally different vegitation.

               <h2>Day Three Salkantay Trail</h2>
            </a> 
            <p>Welcome to the jungle!! Day three we were able to breath a lot easier. The hike was still challenging with many ups and downs. This is where the blisters started to get bad though. PSA please break in your
               hiking boots before the big hike!! The blisters on my feet started on day two of this hike, but this day took them to another level. The scenary was amazing though. Ive never seen so many wild fruit trees. 
               There were wild mango trees and strawberries just lining the trail. We also saw some coffe farms with coffee trees everywhere on the side of the mountain. There were amazing waterfalls and rivers. It was 
               just a beautiful place to be. That night they had set up a party for us in the town we stayed in. They had beer and food for us which was very much welcome. I think we were all in a little pain at this point
               They asked if we would want to hike again the next day to Aguas Caliente or if we would like an adventure day with going to some of the shops in the small towns and ziplining. We all chose the later.

            <a name="Day Four">
               <h2>Day Four Way to Machu Picchu</h2>
            </a>   
            <p>Day four was a very welcomed break from all of the hiking. We got to do some epic ziplining and just hung out in a small village with shopping and food. I didn't get to take too many pictures this day phone was dead
               and we didn't make it to a charger till we got to the town. We started the day with ziplining. They came to pick us up in some vans after breakfast. They took us to the base of a huge ravine. There were six different
               ziplines that went across this massive ravine with a river flowing through the middle. They got us suited up and gave us instructions on how to zip line between these mountains. They let us go across in what they 
               called the spider man position. This position you hang upside down and go in between these mountains. Stella has video of me doing this and it was awesome!! After this adventure we were hungry so we went to the town 
               where we picked up some food and walked around the shops where they were selling all the typical things that people bring back from Peru, like the blankets and hats and gloves made from alpaca. I tried to not walk so 
               much because at this point my feet were on fire with the blisters. We played some cards &hearts; &clubs; &spades; &Diamond; and spoke with some of the other hikers. We then loaded up into the busses and they took us to the trail entrance to Aguas Calientes. The hike was very short but my feet were killing me so it 
               made it difficult. The trail was very narrow with a train track that ran through it. There was one train that ran by while we were hiking. It was within arms length from us and moving very quickly. Deffinitley a little 
               scary. We finally made it to Aguas Calientes which is the town at the base of the mountain that Machu Picchu is on top of. It is like the staging area if you want to hike up to it. We chose the bus though due to my 
               blisters. We got to our hostile there and met up with Stellas brother and freind again. They took the bus up there after they recovered a bit from the food poisning. We met up for dinner with the guides and the rest of 
               our group. While walking the streets of Aguas Calientes I just coudn't take the pain from the blisters anymore so we went to a clinic where they popped one of them and wrapped it for me so we could enjoy Machu Picchu.

            <a name="Day Five">
               <h2>Day Five Machu Picchu</h2>
            </a>
            <p>The last day of this hiking adventure took us to one of the most enchanting places I have ever been. The great Incan city of Machu Picchu. This ancient city built on the top of the mountains is breath taking. It is just 
               unbeleivable how they constructed something like this on the top of this mountain so long ago. I did get some great pictures while we were there. I even managed to get one that looks like the nat geo pic that everyone has
               seen of Machu Picchu. We saw the Inca bridge on the back side of the mountain. This is just a wood bridge along the wall of a sheer cliffside where the Incan messangers used to enter the city. You can see this bridge in the
               photo below( The one with the Burt Reynolds pose). What I was not expecting however is Stella and her brother found out we could hike up a mountain called Machu Picchu mountain which is next to the city. It is where the 
               preists used to go up and worship their gods. It is a very steep path with steps carved out in the mountain side. It is 7,972 ft above Machu Picchu. It was a tough decision cosidering the blisters, but I am glad I toughed it
               out. The view from the top was amazing. It is crazy how small Machu Picchu city looks from up there. As you can see in the picture with us refuling with tuna packs. We then made our way back down and to Cuzco. We picked up our 
               bags which we left there in the hostile, and prepared to head back to Lima.

               <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </a>
            <p class= "funParagraph">This has to be the best trip I have ever taken in my life. It was well worth it and actually not that expensive. I will always remember this trip and the cool part is that the trip actually wasn't over for us yet. We still had two more counties
               to visit in South America. This was just the first leg of our three county tour of South America. I would have to say though that it was probably my favorite of the Three countries we went to. The blisters were well worth it. Join me soon for 
               more adventures as we explored Ecuador and then Colombia.
